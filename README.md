#Source-Remote
This is a tool written in php to control source based games while you are on the go.
It use koraktors steam-condenser to communicate with servers, and a older version known to work with this tool is already installed for easy use - you might want to update yours to korakotrs newest.

I only made it just-work for me, but you might wan't to make changes to make it work for you.
#Installation
Use 
    git clone https://github.com/Herover/Source-Remote.git 
to download files.

You will need to edit config.php to match your settings.

Edit you php.ini file to have this setting "output_buffering = On" or "output_buffering=4096".

#TODO
 * The current logging/banning module might be broken. This needs to be fixed.
 * Support for mod specific kick/ban commands and other commands
 * More testing


You are more than welcome to help with out :)
